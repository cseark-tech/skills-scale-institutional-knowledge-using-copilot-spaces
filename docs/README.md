# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains standardized project management process documents for the OctoAcme program. These living documents centralize essential workflows, clarify key personas and roles, and encode best practices to ensure repeatable, high-quality delivery across teams.

## Overview of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project management approach follows a clear, iterative lifecycle:

- **Initiation & Planning:** Projects start by validating the business need, aligning stakeholders, and setting measurable goals. This results in a Project One-pager and other kickoff artifacts. Planning breaks work into shippable increments, drafts an initial backlog, and documents dependencies, risks, and a roadmap.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Teams use a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and structured, reviewable pull requests. Daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and demos ensure steady progress, while clear escalation paths help address blockers quickly. Automated tests and manual QA are built into the process for quality.
- **Risk & Communication:** A risk register tracks and mitigates risks and dependencies. Stakeholder communication follows a regular cadence (status updates, incident reports, retrospectives), with templates to aid transparency and consistency.
- **Release & Deployment:** Releases are standardized by type (patch/minor/major), require passing CI and acceptance criteria, and use checklists for pre-release, deployment, verification, and rollback/incident response. Release notes and stakeholder announcements are routine.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** After each milestone or incident, teams run retrospectives to capture learnings and prioritize actionable improvements. Action items are tracked in the backlog.
- **Roles & Personas:** Clearly defined roles—project manager, product manager, developer, QA—guide responsibilities and communications, promoting effective collaboration and accountability.
